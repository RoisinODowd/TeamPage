<h1>Company Mission</h1>

<p>
  Since 2006, Roc's Ice Cream has always strived to create the best quality ice cream to give
  our customers at the best prices. We do this by continuously testing new flavors and recipes of ice cream
  so that our treats remain the most innovative ice creams in the world.
</p>

<p>
  All of our ice cream is homemade and prepared using only the most fresh ingredients from
  our own personal farm, which is located in Schenley park. This local sourcing demonstrates our commitment
  to using our business to benefit the Pittsburgh community and keep our ingredients, as well
  as our products, as local as possible.
</p>

<p>
  We always want to see our clients enjoying their ice cream, so we ask all of our customers
  for feedback and recommendations on how to improve.  Recently, Roc's has expanded to have more
  employees but even though we are growing in numbers of employees, we pledge to remain
  a family business that continues to provide customized service and puts our customers first.
