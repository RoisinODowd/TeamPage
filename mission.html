  <h2 align="center">Mission Statement</h2>

  <p>
    Since 2006, Roc's Ice Cream has always strived to create the best quality ice cream to give our customers at the best prices. We do this by continuously testing new flavors and recipes of ice cream so that our treats remain the most innovative ice creams
    in the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    All of our ice cream is homemade and prepared using only the most fresh ingredients from our own personal farm, which is located in Schenley park. This local sourcing demonstrates our commitment to using our business to benefit the Pittsburgh community
    and keep our ingredients, as well as our products, as local as possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    We always want to see our clients enjoying their ice cream, so we ask all of our customers for feedback and recommendations on how to improve. Recently, Roc's has expanded to have more employees but even though we are growing in numbers of employees,
    we pledge to remain a family business that continues to provide customized service and puts our customers first.
